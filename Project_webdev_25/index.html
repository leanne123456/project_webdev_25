        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Future Goals:</strong>  
        As a future Mathematics and Computer Science teacher, my goal is to create a vibrant, engaging, and innovative learning environment where students develop a deep appreciation for these subjects.  
        I am passionate about making complex topics accessible through interactive lessons, real-world applications, and the integration of technology.  
        My ambition is to equip students with the problem-solving skills they need for both academia and industry. I also plan to continue my own education, researching new teaching methods and advancing my expertise in educational technology.</p>
    
        <p><strong>People Who Inspire Me:</strong>  
        I admire Kathryn Parsons, founder of Decoded, for her work in making coding and digital skills accessible to all. This inspires me to incorporate technology-driven learning into my teaching.  
        Mary Boole, a pioneer in Mathematics education, inspires me with her creative, hands-on teaching methods, encouraging me to make Maths more intuitive and engaging for students.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Hobbies & Passions:</strong>  
            My hobbies connect deeply with my ambition to be a teacher.<br><br>
        
            Sports have taught me discipline and teamwork, essential for managing a classroom.<br><br>  
        
            Music, through classical piano and violin, has strengthened my patience and dedication, skills I bring into my teaching.<br><br>  
        
            Farming, which requires problem-solving and adaptability, has shaped my approach to tackling challenges in education.</p>
