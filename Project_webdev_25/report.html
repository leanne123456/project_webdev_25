        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a personal portfolio webpage designed to showcase my background, skills, and aspirations in an engaging and structured format. 
            The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness and a modern aesthetic. It meets all the required project guidelines, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A colored background that adapts to different screen sizes.</li>
            <li>Well-organized sections for clear navigation.</li>
            <li>A responsive table to display categorized information.</li>
            <li>Deployment using GitHub Pages.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-5">
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
            Before development, I created a boxified wireframe on paper to outline the website structure. This helped define key sections:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Header with my name and profile picture.</li>
            <li>Content areas like "About Me", "Skills", "Education", and "Employment".</li>
            <li>A table for categorized information.</li>
            <li>A footer linking to my GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I then digitized this design and embedded it under "My Design Process" on my portfolio page.</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        
        <h3>1. HTML Structure</h3>
        <p>
            The webpage consists of structured sections using Bootstrap's grid system:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Navigation Bar:</strong> Allows seamless navigation between pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Header:</strong> Includes my name, job title, and profile image.</li>
            <li><strong>About Me:</strong> A full-width section providing a short introduction.</li>
            <li><strong>Skills & Interests:</strong> A structured table displaying my skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Education & Employment:</strong> Neatly formatted lists of my background.</li>
            <li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Showcasing important milestones.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflection & Future Plans:</strong> My thoughts on the project and potential improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Footer:</strong> Includes a GitHub link and navigation back to the homepage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. CSS & Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>
            The design uses Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling. Key features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Background color change based on screen size (white for screens smaller than 460px).</li>
            <li>Header is centered and balanced, with a properly aligned profile image.</li>
            <li>All elements are fully responsive, ensuring mobile-friendliness.</li>
            <li>The employment section was adjusted for better readability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Bootstrap & Table Integration</h3>
        <p>
            Bootstrap classes are used throughout the page for spacing and layout. The table meets project requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains at least three rows and two columns.</li>
            <li>Displays structured, categorized information.</li>
            <li>Fully responsive, adapting to smaller screens.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-5">
        <h2>Media Queries & Adaptive Design</h2>
        <p>
            The website's CSS media queries ensure it adjusts based on screen width:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For small screens (less than 460px), the background changes to white for readability.</li>
            <li>All sections stack vertically, ensuring no content overlap.</li>
            <li>Tables and images resize dynamically to fit the screen.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-5">
        <h2>GitHub Deployment</h2>
        <p>
            The project was deployed using GitHub Pages, following these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Created a GitHub repository named <code>project_webdev_25</code>.</li>
            <li>Pushed all HTML, CSS, and images to the repository.</li>
            <li>Enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings.</li>
            <li>Ensured the live site link worked properly before submission.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-5">
        <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Header Image Alignment:</strong> Adjusted CSS to balance text and image positioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Table Responsiveness:</strong> Used Bootstrap classes to prevent content overflow.</li>
            <li><strong>Employment Section Formatting:</strong> Improved layout for readability.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-5">
        <h2>Reflection & Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
            This project allowed me to apply Bootstrap, CSS media queries, and GitHub deployment. If I were to expand it, I would:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add animations and hover effects for a more interactive experience.</li>
            <li>Implement a contact form to improve engagement.</li>
            <li>Enhance the design with advanced CSS techniques.</li>
            <li>Use JavaScript for additional interactivity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, this project provided valuable experience in responsive web design and deployment.</p>
